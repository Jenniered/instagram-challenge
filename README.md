Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

The challenge was to build Instagram. 

The aim: You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome). Bonus if you can add filters!

## User stories
1. As a user, 
> so that I know I'm in the right place,
> I want to see a title and welcome to Instagram

As a user, 
> so that I can log in to use the site,
> I want to be able to sign up

3. As a user,
> so that I can use the site,
> I want to be able to log in

4. As a user,
> so that I can see what others have posted
> I want to be able to see all pictures

5. As a user,
> so that I can share content
> I want to be able to post my pictures
