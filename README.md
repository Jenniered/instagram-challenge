Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

The challenge was to build Instagram. 

The aim: You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome). Bonus if you can add filters!

## User stories
1. As a user,  
so that I know I'm in the right place,  
I want to see a title and welcome to Instagram.

2. As a user,  
so that I can log in to use the site,  
I want to be able to sign up.

3. As a user,  
so that I can use the site,  
I want to be able to log in.

4. As a user,  
so that I can see what others have posted,  
I want to be able to see all pictures.

5. As a user,  
so that I can share content,  
I want to be able to post my pictures.
